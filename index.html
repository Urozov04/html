    <h5>
        I am Dilshod and surname is Urozov. I was born on August 8, 2004, in <br>
        Kizirik district in Surkhandarya region. I studied at School N40 in <br>
        Kizirik district. I was admitted to school in 2011. But after 3 years, We moved to Tashkent with my family. After finishing <br>
        school, I applied to a state university but was not accepted, then I decided to apply to non-state university (UTAS). <br>
        But after 2 years, I think deeply and I decided to freeze my study, Then I heard about Najot ta'lim from my friends<br> 
        and I studied in that about a year. I learned NodeJs and ReactJs for being full-stack developer.<br>
